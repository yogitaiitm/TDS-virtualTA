Once you’ve prepared the data, your next task is to analyze it to get insights that are not immediately obvious.

In this module, you’ll learn:

* **Statistical analysis**: Calculate correlations, regressions, forecasts, and outliers using **spreadsheets**
* **Data summarization**: Aggregate and pivot data using **Python** and **databases**.
* **Geo-data Collection & Processing**: Gather and process geospatial data using tools like Python (GeoPandas) and QGIS.
* **Geo-visualization**: Create and visualize geospatial data on maps using Excel, QGIS, and Python libraries such as Folium.
* **Network & Proximity Analysis**: Analyze geospatial relationships and perform network analysis to understand data distribution and clustering.
* **Storytelling & Decision Making**: Develop narratives and make informed decisions based on geospatial data insights.
