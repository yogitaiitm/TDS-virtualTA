You’ll learn how to transform data using dbt (data build tool), covering:

* **dbt Fundamentals**: Understand what dbt is and how it brings software engineering practices to data transformation
* **Project Setup**: Learn how to initialize a dbt project, configure your warehouse connection, and structure your models
* **Models and Materialization**: Create your first dbt models and understand different materialization strategies (view, table, incremental)
* **Testing and Documentation**: Implement data quality tests and auto-generate documentation for your data models
* **Jinja Templating**: Use Jinja for dynamic SQL generation, making your transformations more maintainable and reusable
* **References and Dependencies**: Learn how to reference other models and manage model dependencies
* **Sources and Seeds**: Configure source data connections and manage static reference data
* **Macros and Packages**: Create reusable macros and leverage community packages to extend functionality
* **Incremental Models**: Optimize performance by only processing new or changed data
* **Deployment and Orchestration**: Set up dbt Cloud or integrate with Airflow for production deployment

Here’s a minimal dbt model example, `models/staging/stg_customers.sql`:

```
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
),

renamed as (
    select
        id as customer_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email,
        created_at
    from source
)

select * from renamedCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
```
