[Interactive Notebooks: Marimo](#/marimo?id=interactive-notebooks-marimo)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Marimo](https://marimo.app/) is a new take on notebooks that solves some headaches of Jupyter. It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.

Marimoâ€™s cells canâ€™t be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.

It also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, Itâ€™s growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.

Common Operations:

```
# Create new notebook
uvx marimo new

# Run notebook server
uvx marimo edit notebook.py

# Export to HTML
uvx marimo export notebook.pyCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
```

Best Practices:

1. **Cell Dependencies**

   * Keep cells focused and atomic
   * Use clear variable names
   * Document data flow between cells
2. **Interactive Elements**

   ```
   # Add interactive widgets
   slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)
   # Create dynamic Markdown
   mo.md(f"{slider} {"ðŸŸ¢" * slider.value}")Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
   ```
3. **Version Control**

   * Keep notebooks are Python files
   * Use Git to track changes
   * Publish on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/) for collaboration
