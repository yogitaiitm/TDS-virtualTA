This session covers the use of OpenRefine for data cleaning, focusing on resolving entity discrepancies:

* **Data Upload and Project Creation**: Import data into OpenRefine and create a new project for analysis.
* **Faceting Data**: Use text facets to group similar entries and identify frequency of address crumbs.
* **Clustering Methodology**: Apply clustering algorithms to merge similar entries with minor differences, such as punctuation.
* **Manual and Automated Clustering**: Learn to merge clusters manually or in one go, trusting the systemâ€™s clustering accuracy.
* **Entity Resolution**: Clean and save the data by resolving multiple versions of the same entity using Open Refine.
