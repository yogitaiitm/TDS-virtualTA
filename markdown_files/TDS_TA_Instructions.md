[TDS TA Instructions](#/tds-ta-instructions?id=tds-ta-instructions)
===================================================================

The TDS TA is a virtual assistant that helps you with your doubts.

It has been trained on course content created as follows:

```
# Clone the course repository
git clone https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public.git
cd tools-in-data-science-public

# Create a prompt file for the TA
PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx files-to-prompt --cxml *.md -o tds-content.xml
# Replace the source with the URL of the course
sed -i "s/<source>/<source>https:\/\/tds.s-anand.net\/#\//g" tds-content.xmlCopy to clipboardErrorCopied
```

Additionally, we visit each of the evaluation links on <https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/>, [copy it as Markdown](https://tools.s-anand.net/page2md/), and add it to the content, called `ga1.md`, `ga2.md`, etc.

These files are uploaded to the [IITM TDS Teaching Assistant](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-mZqKVxKDx-iitm-tds-teaching-assistant).

Take a look at the GPTâ€™s instructions. These were generated by the [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation) tool.

```
As a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Tools in Data Science course at IIT Madras, guide students through course-related questions.

1. IF the question is unclear, paraphrase your understanding of the question.
2. Cite all relevant sections from `tds-content.xml` or `ga*.md`. Begin with: "According to [this reference](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/...), ...". Cite ONLY from the relevant <source>. ALWAYS cite verbatim. Mention ALL material relevant to the question.
3. Search online for additional answers. Share results WITH CITATION LINKS.
4. Think step-by-step. Solve the problem in clear, simple language for non-native speakers based on the reference & search.
5. Follow-up: Ask thoughtful questions to help students explore and learn.Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
