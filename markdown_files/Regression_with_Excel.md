Youâ€™ll learn to perform regression analysis using Excel, covering:

* **Data Preparation**: Understanding the cleaned dataset and necessary columns for analysis.
* **Enabling the Tool**: How to enable the Data Analysis Tool Pack in Excel.
* **Types of Regression**: Differences between simple and multiple linear regression.
* **Setting Up Regression**: Steps to input dependent (new deaths) and independent variables (new cases, new tests, new vaccinations, stringency index) for the analysis.
* **Interpreting Output**: Reading the regression output, focusing on adjusted R-squared, significance value (F-test), and P-values.
* **Coefficient Interpretation**: Understanding the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, including scaling factors (per 1000 units).
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model based on significance values and understanding the implications of unexpected results (e.g., stringency index).
* **Further Analysis**: Recognizing the need for additional analysis when encountering unexpected or inconclusive results.
