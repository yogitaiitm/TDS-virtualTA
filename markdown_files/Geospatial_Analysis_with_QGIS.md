You’ll learn how to use QGIS for geographic data processing, covering:

* **Shapefiles and KML Files**: Create and manage shapefiles and KML files for storing and analyzing geographic information.
* **Downloading QGIS**: Install QGIS on different operating systems and familiarize yourself with its interface.
* **Geospatial Data**: Access and utilize shapefiles from sources like Diva-GIS and integrate them into QGIS projects.
* **Creating Custom Shapefiles**: Learn how to create custom shapefiles when existing ones are unavailable, including creating a shapefile for South Sudan.
* **Editing and Visualization**: Use QGIS tools to edit shapefiles, add attributes, and visualize geographic data with various styling and labeling options.
* **Exporting Data**: Export shapefiles or KML files for use in other applications, such as Google Earth.
