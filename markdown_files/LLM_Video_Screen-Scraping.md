[LLM Video Screen-Scraping](#/llm-video-screen-scraping?id=llm-video-screen-scraping)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Video screen-scraping with LLMs is a powerful technique for extracting structured data from screen recordings. This approach works with any visible screen content and bypasses traditional web scraping limitations like authentication or anti-scraping measures.

* Works with any visible screen content
* Full control over data exposure
* Extremely cost-effective (< $0.001 per short video)
* Bypasses anti-scraping measures
* Handles varying formats and layouts

### [Quick Start Example](#/llm-video-screen-scraping?id=quick-start-example)

Here’s a basic workflow using Google’s AI Studio and Gemini:

1. **Record the Screen**
   * Use QuickTime (Mac) or Windows Game Bar (Windows), Screen2Gif, or any tool of your choice
   * Select specific screen area containing target data
   * Record scrolling/clicking through content
   * Keep recordings short (30-60 seconds)
2. **Process with Gemini**
   * Upload to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/prompts)
   * Select Gemini 1.5 Flash (cost-effective)
   * Prompt for structured output (JSON/CSV)

Example prompt for extracting tabular data:

```
Turn this video into a JSON array where each item has:
{
  "date": "yyyy-mm-dd",
  "amount": float
}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied
```
