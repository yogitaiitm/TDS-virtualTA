* **Scraping**: How to extract data from web pages, including constructing URLs, fetching page content, and parsing HTML using packages like [`lxml`](https://lxml.de/) and [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/).
* **Caching**: Implementing a caching strategy to avoid redundant data fetching for efficiency and reliability.
* **Error Handling and Debugging**: Practical tips for troubleshooting, such as using liberal print statements, breakpoints for in-depth debugging, and the concept of “rubber duck debugging” to clarify problems.
* **LLMs**: Benefits of Gemini / ChatGPT for code suggestions and troubleshooting.
* **Real-World Application**: How quick proofs of concept to showcase capabilities to clients, emphasizing practice over theory.
