[AI Editor: GitHub Copilot](#/github-copilot?id=ai-editor-github-copilot)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

AI Code Editors like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Windsurf](http://windsurf.com/), [Roo Code](https://roocode.com/), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), [Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/), etc. use LLMs to help you write code faster.

Most are built on top of [VS Code](#/vscode). These are now a standard tool in every developerâ€™s toolkit.

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is [free](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans) (as of May 2025) for 2,000 completions and 50 chats.
