Youâ€™ll learn how to scrape data from Wikipedia using the `wikipedia` Python library, covering:

* **Installing and Importing**: Use pip install to get the Wikipedia library and import it with import wikipedia as wk.
* **Keyword Search**: Use the search function to find Wikipedia pages containing a specific keyword, limiting results with the results argument.
* **Fetching Summaries**: Use the summary function to get a concise summary of a Wikipedia page, limiting sentences with the sentences argument.
* **Retrieving Full Pages**: Use the page function to obtain the full content of a Wikipedia page, including sections and references.
* **Accessing URLs**: Retrieve the URL of a Wikipedia page using the url attribute of the page object.
* **Extracting References**: Use the references attribute to get all reference links from a Wikipedia page.
* **Fetching Images**: Access all images on a Wikipedia page via the images attribute, which returns a list of image URLs.
* **Extracting Tables**: Use the pandas.read\_html function to extract tables from the HTML content of a Wikipedia page, being mindful of table indices.
