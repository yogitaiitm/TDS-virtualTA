Youâ€™ll learn how to perform data analysis using SQL (via Python), covering:

* **Database Connection**: How to connect to a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy and Pandas.
* **SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries directly from a Python environment to retrieve and analyze data.
* **Counting Rows**: Use SQL to count the number of rows in a table.
* **User Activity Analysis**: Query and identify top users by post count.
* **Post Concentration**: Determine if a small percentage of users contribute the majority of posts using SQL aggregation.
* **Correlation Calculation**: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between user attributes such as age and reputation.
* **Regression Analysis**: Compute the regression slope to understand the relationship between views and reputation.
* **Handling Large Data**: Perform calculations on large datasets by fetching aggregated values from the database rather than entire datasets.
* **Statistical Analysis in SQL**: Use SQL as a tool for statistical analysis, demonstrating its power beyond simple data retrieval.
* **Leveraging AI**: Use ChatGPT to generate SQL queries and Python code, enhancing productivity and accuracy.
