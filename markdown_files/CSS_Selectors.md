-------------------------------------------------

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.

For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:

* Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
* Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
* Styling data visualizations and web applications
* Debugging website issues using browser DevTools

The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides detailed documentation on the three main types of selectors:

* [Basic CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors): Learn about element (`div`), class (`.container`), ID (`#header`), and universal (`*`) selectors
* [Attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Attribute_selectors): Target elements based on their attributes or attribute values (`[type="text"]`)
* [Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Combinators): Use relationships between elements (`div > p`, `div + p`, `div ~ p`)
