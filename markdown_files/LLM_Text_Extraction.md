[LLM Text Extraction](#/llm-text-extraction?id=llm-text-extraction)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

[JSON](#/json) is one of the most widely used formats in the world for applications to exchange data.

This video explains how to use LLMs to extract structure from unstructured data, covering:

* **LLM for Data Extraction**: Use OpenAI’s API to extract structured information from unstructured data like addresses.
* **JSON Schema**: Define a JSON schema to ensure consistent and structured output from the LLM.
* **Prompt Engineering**: Craft effective prompts to guide the LLM’s response and improve accuracy.
* **Data Cleaning**: Use string functions and OpenAI’s API to clean and standardize data.
* **Data Analysis**: Analyze extracted data using Pandas to gain insights.
* **LLM Limitations**: Understand the limitations of LLMs, including potential errors and inconsistencies in output.
* **Production Use Cases**: Explore real-world applications of LLMs for data extraction, such as customer service email analysis.

Structured Outputs is a feature that ensures the model will always generate responses that adhere to your supplied
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), so you don’t need to worry about the model omitting a required key,
or hallucinating an invalid enum value.

Here’s what the `response_format` tells OpenAI. The items marked ⚠️ are OpenAI specific requirements for the JSON schema.

* `"type": "json_schema"`: We want you to generate a JSON response that follows this schema.
* `"json_schema":`: We’re going to give you a schema.
  + `"name": "math_response"`: The schema is called `math_response`. (We can call it anything.)
  + `"strict": true`: Follow the schema exactly.
  + `"schema":`: Now, here’s the actual JSON schema.
    - `"type": "object"`: Return an object. ⚠️ The root object **must** be an object.
    - `"properties":`: The object has these properties:
      * `"steps":`: There’s a `steps` property.
        + `"type": "array"`: It’s an array.
        + `"items":`: Each item in the array…
          - `"type": "object"`: … is an object.
          - `"properties":`: The object has these properties:
            * `"explanation":`: There’s an `explanation` property.
              + `"type": "string"`: … which is a string.
            * `"output":`: There’s an `output` property.
              + `"type": "string"`: … which is a string, too.
          - `"required": ["explanation", "output"]`: ⚠️ You **must** add `"required": [...]` and include **all** fields int he object.
          - `"additionalProperties": false`: ⚠️ OpenAI requires every object to have `"additionalProperties": false`.
      * `"final_answer":`: There’s a `final_answer` property.
        + `"type": "string"`: … which is a string.
    - `"required": ["steps", "final_answer"]`: ⚠️ You **must** add `"required": [...]` and include **all** fields in the object.
    - `"additionalProperties": false`: ⚠️ OpenAI requires every object to have `"additionalProperties": false`.
